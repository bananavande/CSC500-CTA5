###Part 1
#Asking for number of years.
years = int(input('Enter number of years:'))

#Calculating the number of months.
months = years * 12

total_inches = 0  #initilizing total inches of rainfall.

#Creating a nested loop.
for year in range(years):
  for month in range(1, 13):
    rainfall = float(input('Enter total inches of rainfall:'))
    print('Rainfall for the month: {} inches'.format(rainfall))
    total_inches += rainfall

#Calculating the average rainfall.
avg_rain = total_inches / months
print('The number of months is {}, the total inches of rainfall is {} inches, ' 
      'and the average rainfall per month is {:.2f} inches.'.format(months, total_inches, avg_rain))

###Part 2
#Asking for number of books purchased.
books = int(input('Enter number of books purchased:'))

#Displaying the number of points awarded.
if 0 <= books < 2:
  print('You earned 0 points.')
elif 2 <= books < 4:
  print('You earned 5 points.')
elif 4 <= books < 6:

elif books >= 8:
